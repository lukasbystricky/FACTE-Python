# Resources

I have uploaded two free books introducing Python that I think are suitable for high school students. 

## The Coder's Apprentice
### Learning Programming with Python 3 (2017)
### Pieter Spronck

*The lecture notes largely follow the first 8 chapters of this book.*

## Think Python
### How to Think Like a Computer Scientist (2012)
### Allen Downey
